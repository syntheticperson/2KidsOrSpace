2KidsOrSpace
============

A software framework to promote the meme that encourages every Human couple, that are contemplating more than 2 children, to expand out into space.

This is based on the following known truths:

The surface area of the planet Earth is finite, whereas the known volume of space is infinite, with the number of Earth-like planets discovered with increasing frequency. Humans share the instinct of all Earth-based lifeforms to reproduce and multiply.

If every Human couple had a maximum of two children, then they would replace themselves, and the Human population would eventually reach a steady state. Which would enable the Human race to coexist in a manageable manner with the Earth's biosphere.

Therefore, families wishing to have more than two children should support space exploration and colonisation.
