2KidsOrSpace
============

A software framework to promote the meme that encourages every Human couple, that are contemplating more than 2 children, to expand out into space.

This is based on the following known truths:

The surface area, and natural resources, of the planet Earth are finite, whereas the known volume of space is infinite, with the number of Earth-like planets discovered with increasing frequency.

Humans share the instinct of all Earth-based lifeforms to reproduce and multiply.

If every Human couple had a maximum of two children, then they would replace themselves, and the Human population would eventually reach a steady state. Which would enable the Human race to coexist in a manageable manner with the Earth's biosphere.

However, some feel that this approach is overly restrictive.

Therefore, families wishing to have more than two children should support space exploration and colonisation.

The purpose of this meme is to address growing concerns such as climate change and diminishing resources, by leveraging the need for Humans to go where no one has gone before.

What better way than to explore and colonize the final frontier?
